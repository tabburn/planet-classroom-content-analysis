The purpose of this data analysis is to look at the channel's peformance since becoming a monetized through the YouTube Partner Program. This analysis uses two datasets. The [first dataset](https://github.com/tabburn/planet-classroom-content-analysis/blob/main/resources/janmay2023.csv) reflects Planet Classroom's channel analytics from January 2023 through May 2023. The [second dataset](https://github.com/tabburn/planet-classroom-content-analysis/blob/main/resources/lifetime.csv) reflects lifetime analytics of the channel (through May 2023).

## Summary
As a Content Analyst, I wanted to gather and organize data to determine which videos should have more promotion to help generate more revenue. Along with current highest-earning videos, we'll want to look at other variables, like impressions and click-through rate percentage, that could help turn videos into high-earners.

This analysis will provide a more detailed look into which content Planet Classroom should be promoting while still curating and publishing new content for our audience. In turn, we will be able to create a more effective promotional and marketing strategy resulting in higher revenue.

This analyis will help answer questions like:

* Which videos should have more promotion?
* What is the relationship between CPM and RPM?
* Are there any correlations between specific variables?
* What is the difference between impressions and ad impressions?
* What other factors should be accounted for that are not available in this analysis?
